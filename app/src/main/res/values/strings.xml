    <string name="about_college">In the 21st century knowledge explosion and globalization took momentum and become a challenge.
        After a long time the state government of Gujarat allowed self-financed institutions to enter into the area of Education.
       As a result today we have a very vast education campus known as "D. C. Patel Navnirman Educational Campus"
        where we run the self financed educational institutes viz.
        (1) D. R. Patel and R. B. Patel Commerce College (Gujarati and English Medium),
        (2) C. B. Patel Computer College (B. C. A.),
        (3) T. N. Patel P.T.C. College (English and Gujarati Medium),
        (4) Navnirman Institute of Management (B.B.A) College
        (5) J.N.M. Patel Science College
        (6) H. N. Patel Pre-primary and Primary School.
        This would have been impossible without the generous donations and active co-operation from the local community.
